I am a graduate student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.nd.edu) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu). My PhD advisor is [Dr. Roxana Smarandache](https://math.nd.edu/people/faculty/roxana-smarandache/). 

My research interests lie in coding theory and graph theory. I have been interested in the construction of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, particularly protograph-based and quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes, and in the optimization of their parameters. To solve problems in these areas, I use methodologies from algebra and applied algebra, combinatorics, discrete mathematics, and optimization. I am also interested in investigating broader families of error-correcting codes, such as generalized LDPC codes and codes from expander graphs, and quantum error correction.
